# Incubyte TDD Assignment

This project is a solution to the Incubyte TDD (Test-Driven Development) assessment. The goal is to implement a `StringCalculator` class using TDD in **Node.js** with **TypeScript**.

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed (v14 or later).
- TypeScript globally installed (`npm install -g typescript`).
- Jest for testing.

### Installation

    cd incubyte-tdd
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Application

You can run the application in development mode using `ts-node-dev` or build it and run the compiled JavaScript files.

#### Local Mode

To start the application in local mode with TypeScript:

```bash
npm start
```

#### Development Mode

To start the application in development mode with TypeScript:

```bash
npm run start:dev
```
